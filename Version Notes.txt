Guess-The-Number v1.0!
(Game 1 v1.0 && Game 2 v1.0)

known issues/bugs

Both Games
-can't handle negative numbers. number needs to be a positive integer either within the given or supplied number range


Game 1
-modifying number range in order to narrow down guesses
	*currently game lists all numbers found through guesses all at once when CPUthingz is called.
	*may be possible to intervene and ask but more testing is needed.
-off by one errors with guessed number
	*sometimes final guessed number in number stack by computer will be - 1 from guessed
	*doesn't happen with every run through but can pop up
-guessed number will sometimes appear in guessed number stack but computer will continue to list more numbers
	*doesn't happen every playthrough so perhaps its number dependent against CPUthingz
-stepfour doesn't seem to load properly after responding yes to previous question(i.e., was number of guesses correct?) I know its not a problem of the function itself because the scenario loads properly from other areas in the game
	leading me to think the problem's within stepfour. It's a not game-breaking issue thankfully. The game is technically over at this point. More  of an inconvenience to the user. 
	The game closes without giving the user a choice to play again or not. 

Game 2
-"Should" be relatively bug-free.
