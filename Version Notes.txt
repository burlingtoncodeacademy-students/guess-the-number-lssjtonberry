Guess-The-Number v1.0!
(Game 1 v1.3 && Game 2 v1.0)

known issues/bugs

Both Games
-can't handle negative numbers. number needs to be a positive integer either within the given or supplied number range


Game 1
-altered guessing algorithm sometimes guesses number in more than seven tries
-stepfour doesn't seem to load properly after responding yes to previous question(i.e., was number of guesses correct?) I know its not a problem of the function itself because the scenario loads properly from other areas in the game
	leading me to think the problem's within stepfour. It's a not game-breaking issue thankfully. The game is technically over at this point. More  of an inconvenience to the user. 
	The game closes without giving the user a choice to play again or not. 

Game 2
-Should "still" be relatively bug-free.
